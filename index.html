    <h1><i>Hey, I'm Kyle</i></h1>
    <h4>The poet-adjacent human behind <a href="https://buttondown.email/hi-q/archive/" target="_blank"><mark><i>Hi-Q</i></mark></a> and curious mind behind <a href="https://curiousmarketers.club/" target="_blank"><mark>CuriousMarketers.Club.</mark></a></h4>
    <p>I like to read, listen, learn, and think about things like marketing, economics, writing, chance operations, haiku and poetry, and how everything is customer service.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I even post about those things (and sometimes I just yell about them in my head while doing something else and forget about whatever seemed smart at the time).</p>

    <p>Currently, I lead the marketing department at <a href="https://www.blueion.com/" target="_blank"><mark><b>Blue Ion</b></mark></a>. I was once a semi-famous banana.</p>

    <p>Before, after, and in between doing these things I cook beans (both the drinking and eating kinds) and wrangle kids (don’t worry, they’re mine).</p>
